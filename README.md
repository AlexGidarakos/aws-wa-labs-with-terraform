# AWS Well-Architected Labs with Terraform

## Summary

This is my attempt at completing the AWS Well-Architected Labs over at https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/ using Terraform instead of CloudFormation. There is also a little bit of Bash added for some templating during initialisation.

I have tried to conform to Google's [Best practices for using Terraform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/best-practices-for-terraform) as much as possible.
